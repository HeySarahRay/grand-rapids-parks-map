# Neighborhood Map

This is an app that highlights my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan, specifically the parks. The area was once covered in glaciers and to this day, it provides a beautiful setting to enjoy any outdoor activity.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* clone or download this project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Once you've completed the above steps, a new browser window should automatically open. Or you can visit: http://localhost:3000/

### Please note
The service worker only in production mode at present. In the future, it will be built in such a way so that it works also in delevopment mode.
